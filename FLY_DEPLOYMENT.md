- Or use: `choco install flyctl` (if you have Chocolatey)

### Step 2: Sign Up (No Card)
```bash
flyctl auth signup
```
- Email: your email
- Password: create one
- **Don't add credit card** - skip that step

### Step 3: Login
```bash

### Step 4: Deploy Your App
```bash
cd C:\Users\wired\Desktop\kalshi-poly-scanner
flyctl launch
```

When prompted:
- App name: `kalshi-poly-scanner`
- Region: `sjc` (San Jose) - or choose nearest
- Postgres database: `N` (no, we don't need it)

### Step 5: Set Environment Variable

```

### Step 6: Monitor Deployment
```bash
flyctl logs
```

You'll see your bot running:
```
Fetching Kalshi markets...
Fetching Polymarket markets...
```
